            Internships are an important part of the college experience, providing students with the opportunity to gain practical experience in their chosen field, make connections with professionals, and learn new skills.
             However, finding and applying for an internship can be a challenge, especially for students at small, rural universities like the University of the Cordilleras (UC).
          </p>

          <p>
            There are a number of factors that contribute to the challenges of finding and applying for an internship at UC.
             First, there are numerous universities within the area which makes it difficult to land an internship considering the competition.
              Second, there are not as many businesses in Baguio that offer internships as there are in 
              larger cities like Manila or Cebu, which means that there are fewer internship opportunities available to students. 
              Third, the internship opportunities that are available may not be aligned with the students' interests which can make it difficult for them to find an internship that is a good fit for their skills and interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenges of finding and applying for an internship can have 
            a negative impact on students' academic and professional development. 
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
                Students who are unable to find an internship may be at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for jobs after graduation.
            </li>
            <li>
                They may also miss out on the opportunity to gain valuable experience and make connections that could help them advance their careers.

        <article>
          <p>The SDGs that are most relevant to the challenges of finding and applying for an internship are Quality education (SDG 4) and Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8).</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
                SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education for all and to promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. 
                This goal is relevant to the challenges of finding and applying for an internship because it highlights the importance of providing students with the skills 
                and knowledge they need to succeed in the workforce.
            </li>
            <li>SDG 8 aims to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men. 
                This goal is relevant to the challenges of finding and applying for an internship because it emphasizes the importance of providing students 
                with opportunities to gain work experience.</li>
            <li>
              Some SDGs can still be considered but we decided not to include them.

            The research methodology used for this Application testing is Scrum methodology. Scrum is a lightweight framework for project management that is used by teams to deliver complex products. 
            Scrum is based on the idea of iterative development, where teams work in short sprints to deliver working software.
          </p>

          <p>
            The research for this will be conducted through a combination of methods, including interviews, surveys, and questionnaires. 
            The interviews and surveys will be conducted with UC students who have had experience finding and applying for internships. 
            Questionnaires will be conducted with the same UC students for the validation board.
          </p>
          <p>
            A series of Emphatizing, Interviewing, and Researching is presented for better understanding.

        <article>
            <p> 5 why analysis is a problem-solving technique used to identify the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking the question, "Why?”. 
            The goal of the technique is to identify the primary root cause of a defect. 
            Each answer reveals a deeper level of understanding of the problem and shows the relationships between the cause and effect of the problem. </p>

            The researchers used the information they gathered through the Google Form they conducted. 
            The 5 why analysis table followed the standard format, having the “Why” question five times, the root cause, and the solution. 
            Having to choose only one solution to focus on.
          <code
            >Figure 1 shows the root causes of the problem, which are: high competition, lack of opportunities, requirements, and more. 
            The figure also shows the possible solutions for these causes which are: attending career fairs, an application that has networking tools, 
            and the chosen solution which is a search application that provide students internship listings they can apply for.
          </code>

          Lastly are the value propositions for this application, which helps students 
          find internship related to their field, virtual job fairs, virtual community, networking tools, wide range of opportunities, and many more.

            The Javelin Experiment Board is a tool to validate ideas through experimentation. The Javelin Board is a visual representation of the testing plan. 
            By being able to visualize the current and future steps, this can make decisions regarding the product’s or service’s path faster.
        </p>
        <p>
            The researchers gathered the information for the javelin board using Google Forms. 
            The forms included a consent statement that participants had to agree to before completing the survey.
        </p>
        <code
            >Figure 2 shows the ‘PIVOTS’ for the javelin validation board which the surveys did not result in any pivoting. 
            For the ‘PERSEVERES’ which all the three solutions are persevered.
          </code>
        <p>
            The first solution is a mobile app that can help students find and gather information about companies for applying internships. 
            The app would have a database of companies that offer internships, as well as information about each company, such as its size, industry, and location. 
            The app would also allow students to filter the companies by their interests and criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second solution is a mobile app that can help students attend career fairs/online job boards for better chances of finding internship opportunities. 
            The app would have a calendar of upcoming career fairs and job boards, as well as information about each event, such as the date, time, and location. 
            The app would also allow students to register for events and connect with potential employers.
        </p>
        <p>
            These solutions would help students find internships by providing them with information about companies, career fairs, and potential employers. 
            The apps would also allow students to connect with each other and network with potential employers.

        <header>Business Model Canvas</header>
        <article>
            The business model canvas is a crucial tool for to map out the key components of the system such as the value proposition, customer segments, etc. 
            This helped the researchers gain a better understanding of how the system would work and how it can be improved.

            <p>It is a tool to which the researchers used to iterate the business model and to help focus on the strengths of the system. 
                With that, they can identify the core competencies and focus the efforts in those areas.</p>
          <code>Figure 3 shows the most important elements of the BMC which are the customer segments and value propositions. 
            For the customer segments, these are the graduates and any students that are qualified to take internship. 
            And for the value propositions, the researchers offer integrated career fairs, internship listings, networking tools, 
            and simplified search for time and cost savings.</code> 
          <p>
            The data gathered for the BMC is based on what persevered in the javelin validation board. Fortunate enough, all of the solutions persevered which made it to the BMC. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Some things are integrated for and modified based on the compatibility of other solutions which are then included in the BMC.

            The SWOT analysis is a tool used to assess an organization in order to identify its internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as external opportunities and threats. 
            The data gathered during the SWOT analysis can be used to inform decisions and create strategies that maximize strengths and minimize weaknesses within an organization.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is important to validate the ideas through experimentation. This helps the researchers determine assumptions that are most likely wrong, 
            and what could have the biggest impact on the success of the system. With success criteria, this will determine whether the solutions persevere.
          </p>

          <code>Figure 4 shows the SWOT analysis which reveals several strengths of the system, including its integrated job boards 
            for various job types, integrated social media platforms, and an intuitive user interface. 
            However, there are notable weaknesses such as the absence of a paid or unpaid filter, potential issues with outdated information, and limited internship listings. </code>

          <p>
            The analysis also highlights opportunities for improvement, such as implementing a filtering tool, using a content management system, and integrating with career services. 
            Nonetheless, the platform faces threats including system bugs, competition in the application market, and data privacy and security concerns.
          </p>

          <code
            >Overall, the researchers are confident that it can overcome its challenges and achieve its goals. To overcome these, the system will leverage its strengths, address its weaknesses, capitalize on opportunities, and lessen the threats to enhance its value propositions. The analysis has provided a clear understanding of its SWOT. 
            This understanding will help the researchers to develop a plan of action that will enable it to achieve its goals and objectives.</code
